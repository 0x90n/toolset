Identifying physical security issues on a 2FA door.

Notes:
Door has two foot-push deadlock bolts protecting the base of each door (3" depth floor ruts).
Door has a magnetic lock protecting the door by PIN code.

Identified issues:

Root Cause:
* Incorrect installation of magnetic lock on the outside area.
* Non-tamper proof screws holding magnetic lock in place.
* Deadbolt can be flipped using an under-the-door tool, on the door side without the magnetic lock.

* Magnetic slide can be split using a metal tool (e.g. shim) if not pulled fully into place, allowing access without deadbolt.
* Roof tiles can be pushed up to travel via roof and bypass the door.
* Default PIN codes can be used to reset the current key-codes based on ROSSLARE schema.
* Hanger/tool can be used to slip through glass side and press 'exit' button.
